          <h1>Day One</h1>
          <p>Outside story floats in fragments, soft against the walls of your stone cottage. It floats like the gold leaves of trees when the night-borer has sucked out their sap and left them hollow from the inside. Falling leaves is a warning that the tree is about to topple, their soft sound whispering death; death for the tree, and, if it spreads through the orchard, death for all of you.</p>
          <p>Your name is Larnie and you are seventeen years old and perhaps you are too old for stories or perhaps you are too young. Either way you need every minute of sleep you can steal here in this cottage outside the citadel, every minute of sleep until the wings of the dragons sweep over your home, waking the birds who squark in excited terror, and then the cows join in and you pull on your high boots and a tunic and tie your hair back from your face to begin a long day's work.</p>
          <p>There's <span id="five">nothing</span> <span id="six">something</span> you want more than stories; more than fresh milk and butter and healthy orchards. <span id="six">You want to forget.</span> <span id="one">You want to forget the years of war, more years than you have lived.</span> <span id="two">You want to forget the smell of burned flesh as the enemy dragons sored.</span><span id="three"> You want to forget that they are not coming back: not Kal, not Raca, not even Mellie who was younger than you and now will be always.</span><span id="four"> You want to forget that you have anything to forget, and that there could be anything you want more than stories and fresh milk and butter and healthy orchards.</span></p>
